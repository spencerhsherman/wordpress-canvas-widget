wordpress-canvas-widget
=======================

A simple, canvas widget plugin for Wordpress that can be adapted for many different purposes.

This plugin will work with any "pluggable" Wordpress theme, and is built to execute simple PHP or HTML code based on user input.

This plugin was written with Remi's excellent tutorial, over at http://www.wpexplorer.com/create-widget-plugin-wordpress/. Note that I ended up having to do a few tweaks to get his final code to work - namely, on line 83, Remi's tutorial omitted $select and $checkbox from apply_filters.
